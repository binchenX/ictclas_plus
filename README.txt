
The ICTCLAS is an open source Chinese Lexical Analysis System,
which is deveoped by Dr. Huaping ZHANG and Prof. Qun LIU
in the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
It is a widely used high performance software for Chinese
word segmentation and part-of-speech tagging.
Thousands of copies of ICTCLAS have been downloaded since it was
published in the CNLP Platform (http://www.nlp.org.cn) in 2003.
However, this is the first package with full English documents.

The purpose of the distribution of ICTCLAS is to promote 
the academic exchanges and the resource sharing in the research 
area of natural language processing.
Users can freely copy, distribute or modify ICTCLAS, 
but it must be in full compliance with all the terms listed 
in "Natural Language Processing Open Resource License Agreement"
 (license version number 1.0).
The author of ICTCLAS will not provide any technical support to 
users and is not responsible for any loss of using ICTCLAS 
(directly or indirectly). For detailed information, please refer to 
the terms of the "Natural Language Processing Open Resource 
License Agreement" (license version number 1.0).
A copy of the license agreement is distributed within this resource.
If you do not find it, please visit the CNLP Platform
(http://www.nlp.org.cn) to obtain a full copy.

This package is the ICTCLAS Version 1.0 for Linux.
The orginal ICTCLAS Version 1.0 is for Windows.
Dr. Le Zhang provided a unix-port for the orginal Windows version 1.0.
This Linux version is made by Prof. Qun LIU, based on Dr. Le ZHANG's 
unix-port and the original ICTCLAS Windows version 1.0.
It is easier to use than the unix-port, without the requirement
of the installation of scons.

All the versions, including the orginal Windows version, the unix-port, 
and this Linux version, can be downloaded from the CNLP Platform
 (http://www.nlp.org.cn).

For instructions of installation and use of ICTCLAS,
please read the file Manual.txt.
For the part-of-speech tags used in ICTCLAS,
please read the file part-of-speech.txt.

ICTCLAS is developed based on a Hierarchical Hidden Markov Model.
It is trained on the People's Daily Corpus developed by
the Institute of Computational Linguistics, Peking University.
(http://icl.pku.edu.cn).  The average precision of Chinese word
segmentation of ICTCLAS on normal new text is about 97%.
